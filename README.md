## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The only part of this project that was difficult for me was setting up the background to work with an image and a color at the same time. I'm not 100% sure that it is supposed to scale down the image when the page resizes, but changing it to be static wouldn't be difficult.
